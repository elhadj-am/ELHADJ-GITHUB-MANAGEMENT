### WORKSPACE FOR JAVASCRIPT


In this repository, we will create exercises around the various elements below, which I consider the basics, and we will also work on small projects, always focused on these elements.


Here's a list of essential topics to learn in JavaScript, ordered from beginner to advanced:

---

### **1. Basics of JavaScript**
- Variables (`let`, `const`, `var`)  
- Data Types (Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Arrays, Objects)  
- Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical)  
- Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `for...of`, `for...in`)  

---

### **2. Functions**
- Declaring and invoking functions (`function` and arrow functions)  
- Parameters and default values  
- Higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)  
- Closures and scope  

---

### **3. DOM Manipulation**
- Selecting elements (`document.querySelector`, `getElementById`)  
- Adding/removing/modifying content and attributes  
- Event handling (`addEventListener`)  
- Form validation  

---

### **4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Creating objects (literal, `Object.create`)  
- Classes and constructors  
- Prototypes and inheritance  

---

### **5. Modern JavaScript Features (ES6+)**
- Template literals  
- Destructuring (`{}` and `[]`)  
- Spread and rest operators (`...`)  
- Modules (`import` and `export`)  
- Promises and `async/await`  

--- 

### **6. Asynchronous JavaScript**
- Callbacks  
- Promises (`.then`, `.catch`)  
- Async/Await  
- Fetch API and working with HTTP requests  

---

### **7. Error Handling**
- `try`, `catch`, `finally`  
- Custom error handling  

---

### **8. Advanced Topics**
- JavaScript design patterns (Module, Singleton, Factory, etc.)  
- Event Loop and how JavaScript handles concurrency  
- Performance optimization  
- Memory management  

---

### **9. JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries**
- Basics of React, Angular, or Vue.js (depending on your focus)  
- State management libraries (Redux, MobX)  

---

### **10. Testing**
- Writing unit tests (Jest, Mocha)  
- Testing frameworks for frontend (Cypress)  

---

### **11. Tooling**
- Version control with Git  
- Module bundlers (Webpack, Vite)  
- Package managers (npm, Yarn)
